# Integrations
After following the initial courses on HTML/CSS from OpenClassrooms I decided to copy multiple templates from html5up to get really comfortable with different layouts. It was a very interesting journey, pushing me to discover a lot of new features through devtools, documentations and questions on stackoverflow.

Each project has its own readme with the live preview.
