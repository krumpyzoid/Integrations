# Spectral-FrontEnd
Front-End integration of HTML5UP's Spectral Theme using HTML5/CSS3/jQuery

LIVE DEMO: https://amazing-roentgen-55d967.netlify.app/

## Technologies
- Pure HTML/CSS responsive layout
- Icofont used as font to leverage the strenghts of `:before`
- Basic CSS animations on `:hover`
- More complex animations using `@keyframes` in the header and intro section
- jQuery to toggle side navigation and transform navigation icon into close icon

## Methods
- Classnames using BEM methodology
- SASS 7-1 structure 

## What I learned
- It was my first project using `@keyframes` and I'm quite happy with the result of the _'Learn More'_ animation. I am also quite happy with the `:hover` animation of the icons in the intro section, which required 1 span for the glow and 4 spans that translate on `:hover` for the snake border.
- I am getting more and more familiar with `:before` and `:after` pseudo-selectors which in this project allowed me to create overlays on the articles' images and display icons on the unordered list while maintaining perfect alignment.
- I feel more and more comfortable with layouts using `display: flex` or `display: grid` as well as `@media` queries
